# What each of the files are about:

-> problem69: On Euler's Totient Function (also called the phi function):
The number of numbers smaller than n and relative prime to it.
Takes special interest in the ratio n/phi(n) are tries to find values
that minimise it.

-> relatively_prime: Uses Euler's method (I think) of finding relatively prime
numbers to determine if two numbers are relatively prime.

-> problem33: objective is to find fractions less than one (with
two digits each in the numerator and denominator) that have this unique property
of being equalling to the remaining fraction obtained after crossing out common numbers
E.g., 49/98 = 4/8 (9 got crossed out)

-> coin_sums: Coins of different denominations can be summed in different ways to produce
a particular resulting value.
Objective is to find the number of ways these numbers can be added to obtain a desired sum
